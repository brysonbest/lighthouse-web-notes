## Callback Functions

Functions can be values in JavaScript, and an important use of them in this way is as a callback function.

A Callback Function:
* Is passed into another function using a reference
* The receiver uses the callback function (calls the function) in its own way
* The receiver can use this function limitless times, and can use it at any point in the function structure

Results can be passed via callback functions!
