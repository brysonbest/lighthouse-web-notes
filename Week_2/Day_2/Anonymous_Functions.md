## Anonymous Functions

Functions do not have to be named, but can actually be anonymous!

Callback functions are usually not declared or assigned a variable, and are implemented inline.

Arrow functions may often be implemented anonymously when done as a callback function.

### Important:

Anonymous functions are most often callback functions. Using them in other instances is usually not recommended.

As callback functions, anonymous functions are invoked by the function they are passed into, and are provided a name by their receiving function.
