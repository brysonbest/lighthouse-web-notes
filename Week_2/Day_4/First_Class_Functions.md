## First-Class Citizen (or First-Class Object) and Higher Order Functions

### First-Class Object

An object with no restrictions on its creation, destruction, or usage.

This object can be passed as an argument, returned from a funciton, and assigned to a variable.

These functions are instances of the Object type in JavaScript.
* They can be assigned properties
* They can be assigned methods

### Higher Order Functions

Functions that take in callbacks are referred to as Higher Order Functions.

These functions are ANY functions that operate on another function.

Higher-order functions are a significant aspect of Functional Programming.

This category includes functions that take in other functions (callbacks) as arguments.

Examples of higher-order functions include:
* ```forEach```
* ```filter```
* ```map```
